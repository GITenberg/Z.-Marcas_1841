description: "Z. Marcas is a novelette by French author Honoré de Balzac first published\
  \ in 1840. Set in contemporary Paris, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant\
  \ political strategist who is abandoned by the politicians he helps into power.\
  \ Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to\
  \ him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political\
  \ situation in France.\nBalzac was inspired to write the story after he spotted\
  \ the name \"Z. Marcas\" on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published\
  \ in July 1840, in the Revue Parisienne, a magazine he had founded that year. One\
  \ year later it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title La\
  \ Mort d'un ambitieux (\"The Death of an Ambitious Man\"). Balzac later placed it\
  \ in the Scènes de la vie politique section of his vast novel sequence La Comédie\
  \ humaine.\nAlthough Z. Marcas features characters from other Balzac stories and\
  \ elements of literary realism – both hallmarks of Balzac's style – it is remembered\
  \ primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's\
  \ lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality\
  \ were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger\
  \ of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.\n\
  The story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator\
  \ of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title\
  \ character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself:\
  \ a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented\
  \ individuals with more social power.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
